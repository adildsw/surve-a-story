# Surve-a-Story
:scroll: Surve-a-Story is a server-based customizable survey/form application capable of serving interactive stories and puzzles.

## Getting Started
The following instructions will help you get this system up and running in your local system.

### Prerequisite
Before proceeding to the installation, make sure that your system contains Node.js.
#### Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Compiling Source
Once all the prerequisites are installed, run the following commands on the terminal to compile the source code on your system:
#### 1. Clone Source from GitHub
```
git clone https://github.com/adildsw/surve-a-story/
```
#### 2. Install Project Dependencies
```
cd surve-a-story
npm install
```

### Hosting the Server
If the source is compiled successfully without any errors, follow these steps to host the Node.js server:
#### Node.js Server
In a new terminal, navigate to _surve-a-story_ folder. Then run the following command:
```
node app.js
```
Upon successful Node.js server hosting, the terminal should return the following message:
```
 Server Running at Port 8888
```

### Launching the System
Once the server is hosted and running, open your browser and navigate to ***http://localhost:8888/***.
Enjoy!
